# Final-Project-Pong

For this first week I didn't have much to do. I just got all of the dimensions and colours for my paddle, ball, and background. My wifi had been broken for the last couple
of days so this is a couple days late. I am currently working on trying to make the ball and paddles move which I think is the hardest part.
