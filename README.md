# Final-Project-Pong
Week 1:

For this first week I didn't have much to do. I just got all of the dimensions and colours for my paddle, ball, and background. My wifi had been broken for the last couple
of days so this is a couple days late. I am currently working on trying to make the ball and paddles move which I think is the hardest part.



Week 2:

This last week I worked on getting my ball and paddles to be able to move. I got the paddles working great but the ball is still giving me some troubles. I am
pretty sure I know the problem and will get it fixed. This week I am planning on finishing up the ball and getting a win and scoring fucntion going.


week 3: 
I got the paddles and ball moving as they should through some testing. I was having problems with getting the ball to actually move and making it contact the paddles. It all works now. I also got the scoring function done and need to add a win function.

week 4: I have nearly finished my code. I have added different levels of difficulty and a start function. The different levels was giving me problems because it was initiating pygame before the speed was declaired and I was stumped for a bit. After taking a step back and looking at the code a simple move of the pygame initializer to below where the speed was defined was the answer haha. all I have left to do is finish the win funciton and if i have time make an external files function that will keep game history inside of it.
