# Final-Project-Pong
Week 1:

For this first week I didn't have much to do. I just got all of the dimensions and colours for my paddle, ball, and background. My wifi had been broken for the last couple
of days so this is a couple days late. I am currently working on trying to make the ball and paddles move which I think is the hardest part.



Week 2:

This last week I worked on getting my ball and paddles to be able to move. I got the paddles working great but the ball is still giving me some troubles. I am
pretty sure I know the problem and will get it fixed. This week I am planning on finishing up the ball and getting a win and scoring fucntion going.
